# Django Portfolio Website

Personal website for presenting myself and my portfolio of project.

## Description

Initially developed as a hands-on project following a Django tutorial (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).
The website had a massive overhaul since its first deployments and still being updated with new projects and
skills as I learn and develop them.
